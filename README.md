The requirements is python version 3 and pygame (also in requirements.txt)

W, A, S, D to move

SPACE to shoot

You have a max of 3 lives, obviously you lose one when you run into an asteroid but when you do and your lives is less than 3 you get a 15% chance to drop a health pack from destroing an asteroid :)

Have fun i guess though its not much :)
